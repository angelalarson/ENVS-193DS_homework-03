# Problem 1. Personal Data

## a. Data Summarizing

I could calculate my average daily steps for days that I am on campus and days that I am not on campus because I believe I walk more when I am on campus. Furthermore, I can group hours on campus to low (1-4), medium (4-8), and high (>8) categories, and find the mean steps per day for each category as I believe my steps are higher when I am on campus for longer.
