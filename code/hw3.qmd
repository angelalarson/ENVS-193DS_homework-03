# Problem 1. Personal Data

## a. Data Summarizing

I can group hours on campus to low (1-4), medium (4-8), and high (>8) categories, and find the mean steps per day for each category as I believe my steps are higher when I am on campus for longer. This will require me grouping the hours on campus by time and then findings the means for each of those groups. 

## b. Visualization
```{r}
personal <- read_csv(
  here("data", "personal_data_sheet.csv"))

```
